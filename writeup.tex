\begin{abstract}
Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, containing vital populations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) distributed throughout the cell. Mitochondria form diverse physical structures in different cells, from cell-wide reticulated networks to fragmented individual organelles. These physical structures are known to influence the genetic makeup of mtDNA populations between cell divisions, but their influence on the mtDNA quality control remains less understood.

\section*{Introduction}
DNA repair is ubiquituous throughout the eukaryotes, and is central to keep any kind of DNA in working order. These mechanisms are characterized by specific genes, encoding protein that interact with DNA and/or other molecules in such a way as so reconstitute the original copy of DNA XXX CITE. Mitochondria are vital bioenergetic organelles responsible for the majority of the eukaryotic cell's energy production. Due to their evolution from within the $\alpha$proteobacteria cite XXX, mitochondria retain small genomes (mtDNA) that are central to their energy producing capability.

Although one might have expected that mtDNA is \textit{more} protected than is nuclear DNA, the opposite is in fact the case. Moreover, depending upon cellular demand, mtDNA mutation rates (nucleotide substitution) tend to be far larger in the mitochondria, likely owing to frequent replication on imperfect ribosomes within the mitochondria. To remain in working order, then, it is vital that mitochondria repair their mtDNA molecules that if they are incorrect, and if they cannot do so, discard the mtDNA entirely -- with its host mitochondrion.
